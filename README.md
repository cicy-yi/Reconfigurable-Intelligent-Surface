Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Enhanced Communication Techniques

In order to build the large arrays for future 6G communications without the expense of multiple antennas or incurring large energy consumption, metasurfaces also known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces. These metasurfaces contains of small scattering meta-atoms which scatters the incoming wave with controllable delay leading to controllable phase shift.

In order to do so the main file consists of the comparison on how the Double-Structured Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (DS_OMP) algorithm behaves on altering the number of common paths between the RIS and all users. The channel creation code consists in the G_channel and hr_channel files followed by the DS_OMP file which contains the proposed algorithm for reduced pilot overhead and wider coverage.

This project extensively uses the numpy array to work on complex vectors and variables and plot them using Matplotlib library in Python.
